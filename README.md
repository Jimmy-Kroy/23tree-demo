# 23tree-demo
This C++ application demonstrates the functionality of a 2-3 tree data structure. It supports dynamic insertion and deletion of elements, providing a clear illustration of balanced tree operations and node restructuring in real time.

# 2-3 Tree Implementation in C++

## Introduction

This repository provides a 2-3 tree implementation in the C++ language. The implementation is based on several articles found on the internet. These articles can be found in the references section, which also offers articles with an in-depth explanation of a 2-3 tree.

For the implementation I used a threaded tree. A threaded tree makes use of a parent pointer. This parent pointer makes it easier to move from a child node to its corresponding parent without using recursion. In addition, I used templates to enable the usage of different data types in the 2-3 tree.
